// so we need to make it Synchronous(blocking code) . actually it does't effect much if we are using a synchronous here cuz it only need to render at the beginning not all the time , so no problem.
//SO MAKING IT THE TOP LEVEL IT ONLY EXECUTE AT THE AT THE INITAL REQUEST.
// The code at the top level only execte once we start the program. In this situation it dosen't matter wheather it is synchronous or asynchronous . it happens only once and only when the code starts. cuz it is very easy to use here.

//Blocking, Synchronous way->
//--> READ THE CONTENTS FROM THE FILE:
//const textIn = fs.readFileSync("./txt/input.txt", "utf-8");
//synchronous version of the read file which takes two argumets.
// 1) is file path["./txt/input.txt"] and 2) is the character encoding["utf-8" if we are using english] if we did't specify it takes as a buffer.
// calling this function will read the data from the file and return it to us.

//Non-Blocking, Asynchronous way ->
// we use the callback function . 1) parameter is the error(if there were any) and second one is the actual data. but the error will always be the first one.

///http.createServer((req, res) => {
//  res.end("Hello from the server! ");
//});
// "res" -> stands for the response. "req" -> stands for the request.
//response object ["res"] will gives a lot of tools for dealing with the response. THE SIMPLEST ONE IS .end( )

// http header basically a piece of information about the response that we are sending back
//'Content-type' : 'text/html' [one of the standard browser header is the Content-type ]  then now browser is acpecting some html.

////
// to create an api : first we need to read the data from the file(i,e json file) , then parse json into javaScript and then send back result to the client

//fs.readFile("./dev-data/data.json");[ this [.] represent the director where we run the node command in the terminal (i,e PS D:\Microsoft Downlodes\Coding\Nodejs\1-node-farm> ] which is our current working directory.

// [OR]
// [ __dirname is the name where the current file is located ] i,e the index.js in this case.
